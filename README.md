# Bangazon Workforce Management Site

Your task is to build an internal web application for the Bangazon Human Resources Department to manage employees, computers, departments, and training programs at our company.

## Getting Started
To start with, we're giving you the following boilerplate code:
1. A SQL script to build and seed your database
1. Models -- you may need to add or alter a few properties on these, but this is a starting point
1. A nav bar in `Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml`

Everyone on your team should:
1. Read the tickets carefully and discuss as a team
1. Discuss as a team how many tickets you think you can accomplish this week
1. Ask Jordan or Tommy to approve your tickets for this sprint
1. Clone down this repo
1. In your SQL Server Object Explorer in Visual Studio, create a new database. Call it `Bangazon-Workforce`.
1. Run the SQL script in this repo on your new `BangazonWorkforce` database
1. Make a feature branch for your first ticket
1. All branches should be named with your initials and the feature you're working on. For example, if Levi were working on creating an employee he might name his branch `ls-create-employee`.
